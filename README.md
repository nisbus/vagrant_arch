vagrant_arch
============

## My dev machine (a work in progress)  
I just started this and am copying my arch box setup to puppet  
This should download my box file and setup the following  
  
Xmonad
Xmobar
Erlang
Emacs

.....  
  
clone this repo and do 
  ``vagrant up  
That should start downloading the box and boot up.  
After booting, try  
  ``vagrant provision  
Puppet should install the above packages.
